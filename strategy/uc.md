Unity of Command is a rare gem in the strategy genre. An indie title which combines an excellent presentation with strategic depth all packaged in one of the most accessible wargames ever.

## The Game

Turn-based, operational level wargame, played in hex maps. Supply is just as important as unit maneuvering. Sometimes you will need to grind down the enemy, but if you find a way to cut his supply you'll have a much easier task. Unfortunately the AI also knows this all too well.
