War In The East is a turn-based strategy game that encompasses the whole WW2 eastern front. While it has a great level of detail, new players can ignore most of the more advanced stuff and minutiae and still have some pretty engaging battles.

The game includes smaller scenarios, ideal for beginners. Tutorials and videos can be found online that will help anyone to learn the game.

Below are some screenshots from the Decision in the Ukraine scenario. This scenario is a mid-sized scenario that takes place in 1943 and has the Soviets trying to recover that region with overwhelming numerical superiority.

Shortly after the scenario starts, the soviets have made some breakthroughs and successfully manage encircling a big group of german units.

Despite some efforts at breaking the encirclement, german units in the pocket are doomed. On the other hand, the germans have also managed to encircle a large group of soviet forces.

After managing to stabilize the front, the germans successfully stop soviet advance in the Ukraine and win this scenario.
