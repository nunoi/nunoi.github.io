War In The East is a turn-based strategy game that encompasses the whole WW2 eastern front. While it has a great level of detail, new players can ignore most of the more advanced stuff and minutiae and still have some pretty engaging battles.

The game includes smaller scenarios, ideal for beginners. Tutorials and videos can be found online that will help anyone to learn the game.

Some screenshots from the Decision in the Ukraine scenario that takes place in 1943 and has the Soviets trying to recover that region.
