Graviteam Tactics series are a real-time realistic wargame featuring mostly WW2 eastern front scenarios. Developed by a small Ukrainian studio, these are amazing games that despite some shortcomings deserve far more success and recognition than they have today.

In addition to the real-time combat layer, the game includes a strategic layer where you can move around units in the large map. When your units meet enemy units you then go to the tactical combat RTS layer.

While this is an RTS game, this is far from a click fest. In reality, when you give some orders to an unit, the unit will not necessarily follow them blindly on the spot. This is a game that rewards careful planning unlike most other RTS games.

## The Series

Graviteam Tactics series includes three different games, each with their set of DLC, although GT:OS and GT Mius Front share a couple similar DLCs that have been ported from OS to Mius.

### Operation Star

The original GT:OS is based on an older engine and has largely been superseeded by GT:Mius Front. Some content, but not all, from the original GT:OS has been made available in Mius Front. If you find this in a good sale and like the genre, its a good buy.
