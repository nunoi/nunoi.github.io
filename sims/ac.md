Assetto Corsa is one of the best racing simulators. Good physics,
great graphics, multiplayer and moddable. 

## Content

Its choice of cars has everything from 50s F1 cars to road cars to hybrid Le Mans prototypes. Official AC tracks are not that many, but should keep anyone busy for 
a long time.

It is currently finished, its developer (Kunos) has stated that they
will not release new content for AC. They are currently working on 
Assetto Corsa Competizione which uses a new graphics engine and features
day-night cycles, rain and other improvements. Unfortunately it only
features cars and a few tracks from Blancpain GT Series.

The original AC is still a very good choice for anyone wanting to
play racing simulators. Also, it has a low(ish) price and is often
on sale. 

## Multiplayer

The multiplayer experience is good. While on ad-hoc races you can find the odd player who crashes into everyone, there is an active community that organizes events where everyone races in a serious fashion.
