to modern day jet fighters as well as helicopters and to a limited extent some 
ground units. Although the base game is free, additional content is payed.

## Free Content

DCS can be downloaded and installed for free. Free content includes

* Caucasus map (covers most of Georgia and some parts of Russia)
* Su-25T (a ground attack aircraft)
* TF-51D (an unarmed version of the P-51D Mustang)

The Su-25T includes a free campaign which although not being up to the standard 
of other commercial and paid campaigns, can provide you with many hours of gameplay.

## Additional Content

Additional aircraft and maps are available but not free and require a payment.
Besides Eagle Dynamics (the makers of DCS), there are third party developers that
produce modules for DCS.
