For a newcomer to any simulation, configuring their HOTAS is always an initial hurdle. Unfortunately, IL-2 throws in some additional difficulties.

## IL-2 control peculiarities

While most controls are the same for all planes, there are a few exceptions that seem odd and may present difficulties for a newcomer. Speaking for myself, after setting up just about everything on my HOTAS (T16000m FCS), it was surprising to find that, for example, the trim seemed not to be working when flying the Me-109.

There was a reason for that, and that is that some planes need to have different control setup for a few things:

* Trim (most planes)
    * Fw-190 adjustable stabilizer (Fw-190)
    * Adjustable stabilizer axis (Bf-109)
* Water & oil radiators (most planes)
    * Bf-109/Bf-110/Spitfire water radiator
    * He-111/Bf-110 oil radiator
    * Inlet cowl shutters (I-16; La-5; Ju-52; A-20 upper cowl flaps)
    * Outlet cowl shutters (A-20; Fw-190 A-5/8; La-5; Ju-88; P-40)

## HOTAS configuration

When I first discovered why some things were not working and that I needed more controls on my already full HOTAS I went about thinking for a few days on how to redo my HOTAS configuration and add the missing functionality. With that many control variations, it didn't seem possible to fit it all on my HOTAS.

Finally I had the idea of assigning different commands to the same button/axis. IL-2 allowed it, and since you cannot fly two planes at the same time, having the same button performing two different actions for different planes should have no side effects.

The final version of my HOTAS configuration is presented below. Whenever possible the controls are overloaded. Trim buttons work for all planes, water/oil radiator axis double as inlet/outlet shutter axis for the appropriate planes.

There are two exceptions: 109/110/Spit water radiator and 111/110 oil radiator that were not possible to map to axis, so they each got their buttons.

### Caveats

This is the setup I currently use. It suits me well but it certainly is not perfect and you may wish to modify it.

Also, if you intend to use this please read the warnings below:
* You may prefer to not assign the gear up/down button. It is easy to make a mistake and raise it while on land, which in most planes will cause your flight to end prematurely. It has happened to me, but I just left it there and have exercised extra caution when messing about with buttons around there.
* This has no provision for multiple engine management. In my experience it is easy to just use the keyboard for the few times I need it.
